# FXFlow - Peer-to-Peer Currency Exchange Demo

FXFlow is a demo iOS application showcasing a peer-to-peer currency exchange platform that matches users making similar transfers in opposite directions. This MVP demonstrates the core concepts of the platform without real API connections or security implementations.

## Features

- User authentication (demo mode)
- Currency exchange request creation
- Real-time matching system (simulated)
- Transaction history
- Wallet management
- Exchange rate display

## Technical Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Combine framework
- MVVM Architecture

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `FXFlow.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

## Demo Mode

This is a demonstration version with the following limitations:
- No real API connections
- Simulated matching system
- Demo currency rates
- No real transactions
- No security implementations

## Product Demo

- Add a wallet in your preferred currency.
- Send money to a recipient in another country.
- Watch as the matching engine finds a peer (or aggregates partial matches for currencies like EGP).
- View transaction details and history, including partial matches and fees.
- Experience modern, mobile-friendly UX with clear status and error/success alerts.

## Architecture & Conceptual Innovation

- **Peer-to-Peer FX Matching:** The core innovation is a simulated P2P matching engine that aggregates user requests, enabling lower fees and faster settlement compared to traditional FX.
- **Partial Match Aggregation:** For currencies with low liquidity, the engine can aggregate multiple smaller matches to fulfill a single transfer.
- **MVVM & Reactive UI:** The app uses MVVM architecture and Combine for real-time UI updates, mapping business logic cleanly to user experience.
- **UX Focus:** The GUI is designed for clarity and trust, with transparent fee display, match status, and intuitive navigation.

## Scaling, Security, and Risks

- **Scaling:** To scale, the MVP would require a real backend, KYC/AML integration, and robust real-time matching infrastructure.
- **Security:** Current demo does not implement authentication, encryption, or fraud detection. In production, strong authentication, encrypted storage, and transaction audit trails are essential.
- **Operational Challenges:** Real-world deployment would require compliance with financial regulations, integration with payment rails, and ongoing monitoring for fraud and system health.
